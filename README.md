# height-management-for-trucks
In this project I build a react native app that make vehicles adhere to height restrictions around bridges and other buildings that might cause devastating damage. This is in light of the recent event that happened at Boksburg, South Africa where a Gas Tanker exploded and caused loss of life and damage to property.
